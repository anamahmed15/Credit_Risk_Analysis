# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to create supervised machine learning models to predict credit risk and to recommend which model is most effective.

Categories of machine learning used to predict a credit risk:

* Resampling Model s- oversampling and undersampling techniques
* SMOTEEN Combinatorial Model of Over and Undersampling techniques
* Ensemble Classifier Models

# Tools:
* JupyterNotebook
* Imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn machine learning libraries.
* LendingClub peer-to-peer data (LoanStats_2019Q1.csv)

# Summary:
Based on the results of the six different supervised machine learning models, the recommended model to use for the determination of credit risk is the EasyEnsemble Classifier as it outperformed the other five models in the analysis by a significant margin.
